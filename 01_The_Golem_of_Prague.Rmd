## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Video Notes

For statistical models to produce scientific insight, they require additional scientific (causal) models

The causes of the data cannot be extracted from the data alone

Causal Prediction - knowing a cause means being able to predict the consequences of an intervention

Causal imputation - knowing a cause means being able to construct unobserved counter factual outcomes

Causal Diagrams - Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

Usually need different models for different queries

DAGs are not enough, need generative models and strategy to derive estimate and uncertainty

Bayesian OWl

1. Theoretical estimand
2. Scientific (causal) model(s)
3. Use 1 & 2 to build statistical model(s)
4. Simulate from 2 to validate 3 yields 1
5. Analyze real data
